        to own, buy and sell collectible NFTs created by individuals or companies (“<u>Collectibles</u>”,
        and each a “<u>Collectible</u>”).  Owners of a Collectible will not own any

        painting, the creator of a Collectible (“<u>Creators</u>”), or the artist that
        worked with the Creator (“<u>Artist</u>”), typically retains a range of IP and
        other rights associated with the underlying digital artwork.  The Creator or
        the Artist may have the ability to enforce their IP rights against users who
        infringe on those rights.  Creators often grant us the necessary licenses to
        promote their Collectibles for sale and to allow secondary trading of each
        Collectible.  </p>
